Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio out of a set of all possible portfolios. This process typically attempts to maximize factors such as expected return, while minimizing factors such as expenses, volatility/risk. There are many different portfolio optimization models. In this project, I am utilizing the Sharpe Ratio.

What is Sharpe Ratio and my objective?
The Sharpe ratio is a measure for calculating risk-adjusted return. The higher the ratio, the greater the investment return relative to the amount of risk taken; therefore, the better the investment. The ratio can be used to evaluate a single stock or investment, or an entire portfolio. In the context of a portfolio optimization problem, my goal is to determine the optimal asset allocation, in other words, to find the optimal weights that maximizes the portfolio Sharpe ratio.

Mathematically Sharpe Ratio is defined as:
Sharpe Ratio=Portfolio Return−Risk-Free RatePortfolio Volatility
 = 𝑅𝑝−𝑅𝑓𝛿𝑝
Less than 1: Bad
1 – 1.99: Adequate/good
2 – 2.99: Very good
Greater than 3: Excellent
