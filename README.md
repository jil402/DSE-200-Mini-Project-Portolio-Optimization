Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio out of a set of all possible portfolios. This process typically attempts to maximize factors such as expected return, while minimizing factors such as expenses, volatility/risk. There are many different portfolio optimization models. In this project, I am utilizing the Sharpe Ratio.

What is Sharpe Ratio and my objective?
The Sharpe ratio is a measure for calculating risk-adjusted return. The higher the ratio, the greater the investment return relative to the amount of risk taken; therefore, the better the investment. The ratio can be used to evaluate a single stock or investment, or an entire portfolio. In the context of a portfolio optimization problem, my goal is to determine the optimal asset allocation, in other words, to find the optimal weights that maximizes the portfolio Sharpe ratio.
